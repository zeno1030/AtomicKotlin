summary: |-
  <p>These are examples and exercises accompanying the <a href="https://www.atomickotlin.com/">Atomic Kotlin book</a>. These materials are designed for both dedicated novices and experienced programmers – no programming background is necessary.</p>
  <p>Kotlin is powerful – not only does it have a rich set of features, but you can also express those features in numerous ways. These features are discussed in the book and presented in the exercises.</p>
